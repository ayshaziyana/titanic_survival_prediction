📌 Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, class, sex, and fare. Logistic Regression is used as the classification algorithm.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the classic Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as:

PassengerId: Unique identifier

Survived: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

Name, Sex, Age: Demographics

SibSp, Parch: Family relationships

Fare: Ticket fare

Cabin, Embarked: Additional info

🎯 Objective
To predict passenger survival using Logistic Regression based on key features from the dataset.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, train_test_split, metrics)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized survival rate by gender, class, and age

Checked for missing values and data imbalance

Handled missing values using mean (for Age, Fare) and mode (for Embarked)

🧪 Preprocessing
Handled missing values

Converted categorical variables (like Sex, Embarked) to numeric using pd.get_dummies()

Feature selection based on correlation and domain knowledge
